  p I&rsquo;ve worked with software developers from all over the world, from India and Brazil, to San Francisco, when it comes to working with contracted developers, trust and communication is paramount. Now having worked with Alfonso and Arne of Small Batch for over two years, they not only have seamless communication with myself as a client but also my team. #[strong Since day one they have taken great pride in their work, providing code that I can trust.]
